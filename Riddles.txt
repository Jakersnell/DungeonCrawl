I have keys but can't open locks. I have space but no room. You can enter, but you can't go inside.	What am I?,-	A keyboard,-	A book,-	 A house,-	A tree
I'm not alive, but I can grow; I don't have lungs, but I need air; I don't have a mouth,-	but water kills me. What am I?,-	A fire,-	A rock,-	Ice A cloud
I'm tall when I'm young, and short when I'm old. What am I?,-	A pencil,-	A tree,-	A mountain,-	A river
The more you take, the more you leave behind. What am I?,-	Footsteps,-	Money,-	Secrets,-	Time
